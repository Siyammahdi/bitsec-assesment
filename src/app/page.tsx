              Hi there! First of all, thank you for taking the time to check my
              work. I really enjoyed working on this task. it gave me the chance
              to try new things, learn along the way, and also have some fun while
              building it. Iâ€™ve kept everything as clean and simple as possible,
              and I hope it feels good to go through. Looking forward to hearing
              your thoughts!
            </p>
